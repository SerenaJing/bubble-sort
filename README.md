Select the maximum and minimum value

1. Compare the adjacent elements. If the first one is larger than the second, exchange them;

2. Do the same work for each pair of adjacent elements, starting from the first pair to the end of the last pair, so the last element should be the largest number;

3. Repeat the above steps for all elements except the last one;

4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 until sorting is complete

The best case :T(n) = O(n)

The worst case: T(n) = O(n^2)

The average case: T(n) = O(n^2)
